# MipSim
MipSim is a MIPS assembly simulator written in c++. The purpose is to open a text file of mips assembly code (.s)
and interpret, compile, and execute the code simulating MIPS as much as possible.

# Instructions
MipSim can interpret most native MIPS instructions, but in it's current stage can only handle a handful of pseudo instructions.
Here's a list of the pseudo instructions MipSim can run:  
li   (load immediate)  
la   (load address)  
mov  (move)  
bnez (branch if not equal zero)  
beqz (branch if equal zero)
